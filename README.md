# Task1
1.Titanic Dataset Analysis  (Day-1)

This project involves exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset to understand the structure, feature types, missing values, and overall suitability for machine learning tasks.

Dataset Information:

Dataset: Titanic – Machine Learning from Disaster (Kaggle)

Records: 418 rows

Features: 12

Target Variable: Survived (0 = Died, 1 = Survived)

Learning Type: Binary Classification

Task Objectives:

Load and inspect the dataset

Identify data types (numerical, categorical, ordinal, binary)

2.Student Performance Dataset Analysis

This project analyzes the Student Performance dataset to understand academic and behavioral factors affecting student GPA and to assess dataset suitability for machine learning.

Dataset Information:-

Records:2392

Features: 15

Target Variable: GPA (Regression)

Task Type: Supervised Learning

Objectives:-

Inspect dataset structure

Identify feature types

Analyze missing values
